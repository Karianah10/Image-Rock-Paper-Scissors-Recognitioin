# Image Recognition: Rock Paper Scissors Classification
Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains my machine learning portfolio project on image recognition for classifying images as rock, paper, or scissors. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify hand images into the appropriate category.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [This](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip), which consists of a collection of labeled hand images. Each image is labeled as either rock, paper, or scissors. The dataset includes a variety of hand poses and backgrounds to capture different scenarios.

## Workflow
1. Preparation: Import tensorflow library downloads and extracts the data, then sets the path and checks the contents of the dataset.
2. Image Augmentation: Enhance the dataset's diversity and improve model performance.
3. Model Selection: Implementing a sequential model, , transfer learning models, or custom architectures.
4. Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed image data using techniques like batch training, and    optimization algorithms to learn the patterns and features relevant for classification.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, loss, val_loss, and val_accuracy.
6. Model Test: Tested the model by inserting new images.

## Results and Findings
The trained model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying hand images into the correct categories. The model showcased good precision and recall for all three classes, indicating its ability to accurately identify rock, paper, and scissors gestures.

Through the analysis of misclassified images and error patterns, we identified challenges related to lighting conditions, hand orientations, and partial occlusions, suggesting potential areas for future improvement and exploration.

## Usage
To reproduce the project and run the code. Ensure that the required dependencies and packages are installed in your Python environment. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different models or techniques, and contribute to enhancing the project.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the application of machine learning techniques for image recognition, specifically for classifying hand images as rock, paper, or scissors. The developed model can be useful in various applications, such as gaming interfaces, gesture-based interactions, or educational tools.
